# Welcome to Netlify

Netlify builds, deploys and hosts your front end.

## Overview

This site is a great example of a project built on Netlify.

All of our documentation is in a [Github repository](https://www.github.com/netlify/docs).

Whenever we push to Github or accept a pull request, Netlify will do a clean build of the documentation with [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and deploy the result.

## Getting Started

Netlify can be used both from our web UI at [app.netlify.com](http://netlify-dev.bitballoon.com) or by using our [command line tools](cli.md).

To start with the web UI, simply head to [app.netlify.com](http://netlify-dev.bitballoon.com) and sign in.

To start by manually deploying a folder with a static site to Netlify, make sure you have `node js` installed and then follow these steps:

```
npm install netlify
cd ~/my-static-website
netlify deploy
```
